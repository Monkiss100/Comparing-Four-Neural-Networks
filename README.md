# Comparing-Four-Neural-Networks
Comparing four neural networks for sentiment analysis. This was for my dissertation which received a first.

For the dataset set the labels to "self_text" and "sentiment_score".
If the dataset doesn't have sentiment scores use the file "bert for sentiment" to add them.

The file "listm_add_sentiment" adds the models predictions to the dataset and can be changed to use any models predictions by changing the .keras.
